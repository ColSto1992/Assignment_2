      <h2>Clouds, Services and Servers</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
<p><h3>Clouds</h3>

Clouds can be defined as a virtual space where you can do things like file storage, email, website hosting etc. there are many solutions when it comes to clouds, you can have your own where you have control over it, but the costs you have to pay for set up can be anywhere form a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, whereas if you pay for your cloud solution you have to pay an ongoing fee for having the service provided to you.
<br>
<br>
If you pay for cloud services the costs can be smaller than setting one up yourself, this is because the company that you pay to have the service already has the infrastructure setup for hosting your cloud needs already. There is also 24/7 support when you need it with payed cloud services with a reputable company, if you have the time to look for the solution that you are after you can usually find it with in your own country for cheaper rather than going with one form overseas.
<br>
<br>
There are many ways to use the cloud these days and one main use besides email, file storage and webhosting of other services is that can also be used for software development, this is where the files can be stored so people can access the files from anywhere in the world for the developers don’t need to be in the same workplace to work on the same project, these “cloud” systems can be deployed in dynamic environments such as public, private and hybrid cloud set ups.
<br>
<h3>Services</h3>

Services refers to the application of business and technical expertise to enable organizations in the creation, management and optimization of or access to information and business processes.
The IT services market can be segmented by the type of skills that are employed to deliver the service (design, build, run). There are also different categories of service: business process services, application services and infrastructure services.
<br>
<br>
Under the term “service” this can be related to what is listed in the above paragraph or to the following:<br>
•	Service or system architecture that is a discrete function or service that runs in the background of an operating system.<br>
•	Service orientated architecture is a design pattern in which an applications components that help provide a service to or for other components through a protocol this is typically over a network.<br>
•	Windows service is a service that runs in the background of the Microsoft’s operating system that helps the computer to run but does not belong to a user within the operating system.<br>
•	Telecommunications service – this can be Internet relay chat service (IRC) this is in most if not all modern Internet Relay Chat networks, webhosting service this is the service of hosting web pages etc.<br>
•	Daemon service – this is a service that runs in the background on UNIX / Linux operating systems.<br>
•	These are just some of the “services” that can be found in the IT industry that relates to computing over networks and within the personal computing space 
<br>
<h3>Servers</h3> 

The term server refers to the running of a program or process running on a platform and refers to a device or devices dedicated to running several server programs that create a platform / network of hardware that then become a host or main server that can run web services like email, webhosting, gaming servers for multiple player games where the processing power of a server is better than running it from a personal computer that may not have the processes or hardware to handle the demand that a server can.
The main role as a server is to handle the load of sharing data to many clients (computers that connect to the server for retrieval of information or running of a program) this can be gaming servers for gaming, web email, websites that are hosted through a company that provide the service for use on the internet/network.
<br>
A server is a computer that acts as a central hub for information and/or as a central computer design to offload heavy-duty tasks from a client PC. Servers are prevalent in all types of businesses and in some homes acting as a media centre. Servers typically feature server-grade hardware which is designed with durability, reliability and longevity as priorities and thus usually costs more than consumer-grade hardware.
Servers are the physical form of storage that you can use to store information, files and run things like gaming servers, website hosting, some phone line systems for large companies if they are using VoIP for their phone systems. The problem with using VoIP is if the internet goes down, there is maintenance on the system for software/firmware upgrades or even server failure, the phone lines that use VoIP are compromised and will not function because of these issues.

Cybersecurity 
<br>
<br>
The definition of Cybersecurity according to (Cyber Security, 2021) is the application of technologies, processes and controls to protect networks, systems, devices, data and programs from cyber-attacks. The main goal of Cybersecurity is to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks and protect systems, networks and technology against unauthorised exploits. 
<br>
<br>
Current Threats and Technology 
<br>
<br>
In the modern world, there exists an ever-evolving landscape of cyber criminals trying to constantly outsmart cyber security technologies (The 5 Latest Cyber Security Technologies for Your Business, 2021). Over the last couple of years there has been a lot of media coverage on Cybercrime, likely because, the impact and scale of these crimes has increased. Some reasons to take cybercrimes seriously and have preventative systems in place: 
<br>
<br>
The targets of attacks are changing – Cybercrime has bigger targets and more sinister motives. Critical infrastructure such as, utility services, nuclear power plants, healthcare facilities, airports and more, are connected to a network. 
<br>
<br>
Cyber threats are becoming more advanced – As technologies to counter hackers’ advance, the methods of attack, the number of skilled hackers and the sophistication of hacking tools also advance. 
<br>
<br>
The aftermath is more severe – From point 1, critical infrastructure is connected to worldwide networks. Almost all companies have business-critical data recorded in digital forms. Even small attacks on the network or system have proven to have cascading effects on operations. 
<br>
<br>
Critical shift in the nature of cyber-attacks – Impacts of a cyber-attack aren’t restricted to individuals anymore, they can span across global economic and political systems. 
<br>
<br>
Cybersecurity is a continual game of cat and mouse with newer technologies available to break into systems and networks. Over time it’s been found that no security is foolproof and will never be. Cybersecurity experts need to constantly use new technologies to fortify their systems and networks. Some of the most advanced cyber security technologies include: 
<br>
<br>
Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning – The application of AI to cyber security is done in a similar way to the workings of two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication confirms user’s identity with 2-3 different parameters. Add additional layers of information, and AI comes into play. Deep Learning is being implemented to analyse data, logs, transaction and real-time communications to find threats or unwarranted activities. 
<br>
<br>
Behavioural Analytics – This is a widely used technique social media and online ads so as to target the right audience. This technique is being increasingly used to develop advanced cyber security technologies. This technique helps find patterns on a system and network activities to detect potential and real-time cyber threats. Abnormal increases in data transmissions for example could indicate issues. 
<br>
<br>
Embedded Hardware Authentication – this is an emerging technology to verify a user’s identity. Authentication chips are embedded into the hardware, employing multiple levels and methods of authentication working at the same time. 
<br>
<br>
Blockchain Cybersecurity – this works on the basis of blockchain technology’s peer-to-peer network fundamentals. Each member in a blockchain verifies the authenticity of the data added. Blockchains create near-impenetrable network for hackers. The use of blockchain alongside AI can establish awesome verification systems. 
<br>
<br>
Zero-Trust Model – this is based on the point of view that a network is already compromised. This leads to enhancement of both ‘internal’ and ‘external’ securities. Internal and external networks need equal protection. Including identifying critical data, mapping flow of this data, logical and physical segmentation. Implementing policies and enforcing them through automation and consistent monitoring. 
<br>
<br>
The Near Future of Cybersecurity 
<br>
<br>
According to (What Is the Future of Cybersecurity?, 2021) it has become difficult for organisations and consumers to know the various spots where they have security. So, in the near future, we might see trends towards consolidation, making information more obtainable, so you don’t have to dig so deep to understand your risks. 
<br>
<br>
There are various technologies that will change and improve Cybersecurity in the future like artificial intelligence (AI), Quantum computing and Quantum cryptography but these will take time to make an impact, we might even be 25 years away from seeing these technologies become commonplace. 
<br>
<br>
In the next couple of years technologies like Machine Learning, automation, Blockchaining, internet of things (IoT) and cloud related technologies, will make the greatest impact. Blockchaining will take place inside more products. Nonrepudiation of data is one cornerstone of cybersecurity. Blockchain could advance digital signatures, identification authentication and time stamping within the next few years. 
<br>
<br>
The most immediate impact will be getting better at automating important things for organisations. In the next couple of years cybersecurity will have a mostly data centric approach. Understanding where your data really is, won’t be necessary to a large extent. Moreover, the importance of data will continually grow each year. 
<br>
<br>
Impact of Cybersecurity 
<br>
<br>
According to (Impact of Cyber Security: An Overview (2021), 2021) Cybersecurity is a large field in the IT sector, an area that needs more attention from people, but unfortunately given little importance. The general population has a severe lack of awareness and knowledge when it comes to cybersecurity, something which creates favourable conditions for hackers. 
<br>
<br>
In layman’s terms Cybersecurity is the science which aims to protect and secure information. According to research by department for digital, culture, media and sports, around 66% of medium-sized businesses have had a security breach over the past few years. Out of these around 50% required new prevention methods and additional staff to deal with these breaches.   
<br>
<br>
Impact on individuals 
<br>
<br>
According to (UNODC, 2021) individuals can have their privacy and security of their data violated. Particularly with hacking, there are a variety of different crimes which can be committed, including malware insertion on a third-party device without prior consent, identity theft, financial fraud, medical fraud and other similar offences. 
<br>
<br>
Impact on Businesses 
<br>
<br>
According to (Impact of cyber-attacks on your business | nibusinessinfo.co.uk, 2021) the impact of a cyber-attack on your business can be enormous, inflicting great damage, affecting the consumer’s trust. The impact to businesses can be divided into three categories; financial, reputational and legal. 
<br>
<br>
Change in cybersecurity and who it affects 
<br>
<br>
According to (Why is Cybersecurity Important? | UpGuard, 2021) human error was the cause of 90% of data breeches in 2019. This means that by training staff and the general population as a whole, as to how to identify and correctly respond to cyber threats, the majority of data breaches could be avoided. 
<br>
<br>
There is a constantly evolving race between hackers and cybersecurity teams. This means that technology is constantly being exploited by hackers and updated to stop these exploits by cybersecurity teams. 
<br>
<br>
Cybersecurity Jobs 
<br>
<br>
Cybersecurity jobs are in demand and will stay in demand for decades to come. According to the New York Times there is an estimated 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs in 2021 alone (Why a cybersecurity career will remain in demand, 2021). Security research shows that most companies have unprotected data and poor cybersecurity practices. Cybercrimes are only increasing, all businesses are potential targets regardless of size, structure or reputation. The two fastest growing skills in cybersecurity are application development security and cloud security, both involve building secure systems rather than responding to attacks. This industry is growing and according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, cybersecurity jobs in general will grow 31% through 2029, whilst the average job growth in that same time period is 4%. 
<br>
<br>
How Cybersecurity will affect the average population? 
<br>
<br>
According to (How Cyberattacks Will Affect The Average Person In 2018, 2021) this question can be seen as; how cyber-attacks affect personal data and privacy, and also, their impact on the political, economic and social systems that we live in. The average person needs to be more careful when they are protecting their own personal data. If a person’s data is stolen the implications range from identity theft, financial losses and reputation losses.  The average person should try to implement some simple safety measures, for example multi-factor authentication, password security, and more. 
<br>
<br>
Cyber-attacks will most likely continue to impact domestic and international politics, hence having an impact on every person in society. Cyber-attacks along with data dumps that contain a mixture of real and false information, are being used to control voters’ opinions. On a more individual level, although high profile breaches occupy most of the media attention, cyber-attacks can target individuals, hacked e-mails, social accounts, webcams and mobile phones are some of the various ways that a person can be hacked. 
<br>
<br>
Ways to Improve your Cyber Security as an individuals 
<br>
<br>
According to this blog (10 Personal Cyber Security Tips — #CyberAware - Cipher, 2021) these are 10 ways for an individual to improve their cyber awareness; 
<br>
<br>
Keep your software up to date – This is an important tip to mitigate ransomware, patching outdated software, both operating system and applications. Patches help remove critical vulnerabilities hackers use to access your devices. 
<br>
<br>
Use Anti-Virus Protection and Firewall – Use anti-virus software only from trusted vendors and only run one AV tool on your device. A firewall helps screen out hackers, viruses and other malicious activity. 
<br>
<br>
Use strong passwords and use password management tool - Passwords are important in keeping hackers out of your data. 
<br>
<br>
Use Two-Factor or Multi-Factor Authentication – This adds additional layers of security to the standard password method of online ID. 
<br>
<br>
Learn about Phishing Scams – don’t open e-mails from people you don’t know, be careful with links (hover over a link to discover where it goes), check for grammatical errors in e-mails and where they came from and be careful of everything. If a friend is infected, they can potentially send you malicious links. 
<br>
<br>
Protect your sensitive personal identifiable information (PII) – This is any information that can be used to identify or locate an individual. It is recommended that you only show the bare minimum about yourself on social media. Consider reviewing privacy settings across your social media accounts. 
<br>
<br>
Use your Mobile Devices Securely - create difficult mobile passwords, only install apps from trusted sources, keep your device updated, avoid sending PII or other sensitive information over text, etc. 
<br>
<br>
Backup Your Data Regularly – Try follow the simple 3-2-1 backup rule. Keep three copies of your data, two different types of media (local and external hard drive) and one copy in an off-site location (cloud storage) 
<br>
<br>
Don’t Use Public Wi-Fi – without a Virtual Private Network (VPN) don’t use public wi-fi. 
<br>
<br>
Review your online accounts and credit reports regularly for changes – A credit freeze is the most effective way to protect yourself, essentially, allows you to lock your credit and use your personal identification number (PIN), and use this when you need to apply for credit. 
<br>
<br>
Some of the top causes of Security Breaches include: Phishing/Hacking/Malware at 31%, Individual Mistake at 24%, External Theft at 17%. In conclusion doing some simple research and being aware can help mitigate the danger that the general public faces, in their daily lives. Simple actions like adding authentication on top of our passwords and having better/stronger passwords in general, will reduce our risks moving forward.
